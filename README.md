Project: Parking Space Counter using Image Processing Techniques

Description:

Objective: Develop a parking space counter application using basic image processing techniques to determine the number of cars present and the number of vacant spaces in a parking lot.

Utilizing Image Processing: Leverage fundamental image processing algorithms and techniques to analyze images or video footage captured from a parking lot.

Car Detection: Implement an algorithm to detect and identify cars within the images using methods like edge detection, contour analysis, or machine learning-based approaches.

Space Identification: Employ image segmentation techniques to differentiate between occupied and vacant parking spaces. This may involve thresholding, morphological operations, or other segmentation algorithms.

Counting Mechanism: Develop a counting mechanism to tally the number of detected cars and vacant spaces based on the processed image data. This can be accomplished through object counting or by analyzing the segmented regions.

User-Friendly Interface: Create a user interface to display the results, providing an intuitive way for users to view the car count and available parking spaces.

Performance Optimization: Fine-tune the algorithms and techniques to ensure accurate car detection and space identification, while also optimizing for speed and efficiency.

Testing and Evaluation: Conduct thorough testing and evaluation of the application's performance using diverse parking lot scenarios and varying lighting conditions to ensure reliability and robustness.

Documentation and Presentation: Prepare comprehensive documentation detailing the project's implementation, including methodologies used, algorithms employed, and the overall system architecture. Present the project findings and outcomes in a clear and concise manner.
